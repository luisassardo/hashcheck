# Security Policy

Hash Checker is built for high-risk users — journalists, sources, and human-rights
defenders — and runs fully client-side in the browser. We take vulnerabilities
seriously and welcome responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **security@c-lab.tools** with:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (a proof-of-concept if possible),
- the affected version / commit and platform.

Please report **privately** — do not open a public issue, pull request, or social
post for security problems. If you need to encrypt your report, ask for our PGP key
at the same address.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours** and to share a remediation timeline
after triage. There is no paid bug-bounty program; we credit reporters in the release
notes unless you prefer to stay anonymous.

## Scope

In scope: this repository's code and the deployed static site. Out of scope: third-party
dependencies (please report those upstream), and social-engineering or physical attacks
against maintainers.

Of particular interest: anything that causes data to leave the browser (the tool must
stay 100% client-side), or a Content-Security-Policy bypass.

## Safe harbor

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security research that respects user
privacy, avoids data destruction, and gives us reasonable time to fix the issue before
public disclosure.

## Languages

You can write to us in English, Spanish, or German.
